# Timetable Optimization Platform

## Overview
This web application provides an intelligent platform for academic timetable generation and management. It uses constraint-based optimization to create high-quality schedules for institutions, supporting features like data management, conflict resolution, and export options.

## Features
- **Institution Setup:** Configure institution details, working days, periods, breaks, and semester dates.
- **Data Management:** Add and manage subjects, faculty, rooms, and student batches/classes.
- **Constraint Manager:** Set hard and soft constraints for timetable generation (e.g., no double booking, room capacity).
- **Timetable Optimizer:** Select a class/batch and generate optimized timetables using advanced algorithms.
- **Timetable Viewer:** View, approve, publish, and export generated timetables as PDF or Excel.
- **Export Options:** Download timetables in PDF and Excel formats for sharing and record-keeping.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- **Icons:** lucide-react
- **PDF/Excel Export:** jspdf, jspdf-autotable, xlsx
- **State Management:** React hooks, localStorage
